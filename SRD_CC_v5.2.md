Playing the Game
Rhythm of Play
The three m ain pillars of D&D pla y are social in
-
teraction, ex ploration, and combat. Whic hever one 
you™re ex periencing, the game unfolds ac c ording to 
this basic pat tern:
1:
 
The Game Master Des cribes a Scene.
 T he GM 
tell s the pla yers where their adventurers are and 
what™s around them (how many doors lead out of 
a room , what™s on a table, and so on).
2:
 
The Pl ayers Des c ribe What Thei r Characters 
Do.
 Typically, the c haracters stick together as 
they tra vel through a dungeon or another env i
-
ronment. Sometimes diff erent ad venturers do 
different t hings: one ad venturer m i ght searc h a 
treasure chest while a second examines a mys
-
terious sy mbol engraved on a wall a nd a third 
keep s watc h for monsters. Outside combat, the 
GM ensures that every character has a chanc e to 
act and decides how to resolve their activ ity. I n 
combat , the c haracters take turns.
3:
 
The GM Narr ates the Results of the Adventur
-
ers ™ Action s. 
Sometimes resolving a task is easy. 
If an ad venturer walks across a room and tries to 
open a door, the GM mi ght sa y the door opens and 
describe what lies beyond. But t he door m i ght be 

circumstanc e might make it challenging for a n 
ad venturer to complete a task. I n thos e cas es , the 
GM might ask t he pla yer to roll a die to help de
-
termine what happens. Describing the results of
-
ten leads to another decision point , whic h brings 
the game back to step 1.
This pat tern holds during every game s ession 
(eac h time you sit down to pla y D&D), w hether the 
ad venturers are talking to a noble, ex ploring a ruin,

D20 Te sts
When the outcome of an action is unc ertain, the 
game us es a d20 roll to determine suc cess or fail
-
ure . Thes e rolls are called D20 Tests , and they c ome 
in three kinds: abil ity checks , sa v ing throws , and 
at tack rolls. They follow t hes e steps:
4:
 
Roll 1d20 .
 You alwa ys want to roll high. If the 
roll has Ad vantage or Disad vantage (described 
later in ﬁPla y ing the Gameﬂ), you roll two d20s ,

the hi gher one if you have Ad vanta ge or the lower 
one if you ha ve Disadvantage .

Ability C hecks
An abil ity check represents a creature using talent 
and training to try to overcome a challenge, suc h as 
forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertain

rules often call for a n ability check when a creature

Gaining Heroic Inspiration.
 Your GM can 
give you Heroic Inspirat ion for a varie ty of reasons . 
Typically, GMs awar d it when you do some thing par
-
t icularly heroic, in character, or entertaining. It™s a 
rewar d for maki ng the ga me more fun for everyone 
playing.
 
Other rules might al low your character to gain 
Heroic Inspirat ion i ndepen dent of the GM™s decision. 
F or example, Human characters start each day with 
Heroic I nspirat ion.
GM can also decide that circumstances grant Ad
-
vantage or i mpos e Disadvantage .
Roll Two D20 s
When a roll has either Ad vanta ge or Disad vantage, 
roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Us e the 
hi gher of the t wo rolls if you ha ve Ad vanta ge, and 
us e the lower roll if you ha ve Disad vantage . For ex
-
ample, if you ha ve Disad vantage and roll a n 18 and a 
3, us e the 3. If you instead ha ve Ad vantage and roll 
thos e numbers , us e the 18.
They Don™t Sta ck
If multiple situ ations aff ect a roll and they all grant 
Ad vantage on it , you still roll only two d20s. Simi
-
larly, if multiple situations impos e Disad vantage on 
a roll, you roll only two d20s.
 
If circumstances caus e a roll to ha ve both Ad van
-
tage and Disad vantage, the roll has neither of them , 
and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple 
circumstanc es impose D isad vantage and only one 
grants Ad vantage or vic e versa. I n such a situation, 
you ha ve neither Ad vantage nor Disad vantage .
Interactions with Rerolls
When you ha ve Ad vanta ge or Disad vantage and 
something in the game lets you r eroll or replac e the 
d20, you can reroll or replac e only one die, not both. 
You c hoos e whic h one.
 
For example, if you have Heroic Inspiration (see

could ex pend your Heroic Inspiration to reroll one

for traps and us e the Help action to aid another 
c haracter who™s try ing to open a stuck door (with 
the Utilize action).
Bon us Actions
Various class features , spells , and other abilities let 
you take an addition al action on your turn called 
a Bonus Action. The Cunning Action feature, for 
example, allows a Rogue to take a B onus Action. You 
can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability, 
a spell, or a nother feature of the game states that 
you can do something as a Bonus Action. You other

kind, which can oc cur on your turn or on someone 
els e™s. The Opportunity At tack, described later i n 
ﬁPla y ing the Game,ﬂ is the most common type of 
Reaction.
 
When you take a Reaction, you can™t take another 
one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction

Social interactions progress in two wa ys: through 
rolepla y ing and ability c hecks.
Roleplaying
Roleplaying is , literally, the act of play ing out a role . 
In this cas e, it™s you as a pla yer determining how 
your character thinks , acts , and talks. Rolepla y ing is 
part of every aspect of the game, and i t comes to the 
fore during s oci al interactions.
 
As you rolepla y, consider whether you pref er an

table, chair, or stone . It isn™t a building or a vehicle, 
whic h are compos ed of many objects.
Time- Limited Object Intera c tions

with objects are limited: one free interaction per

ﬁCombatﬂ later in ﬁPla y ing the Game .ﬂ
Finding Hidden Objec ts
When your character searc hes for hidden things , 
such as a secret door or a trap, the GM t ypically asks 
you to make a Wisdom (Perc eption) check, prov ided 
you describe the c haracter searc hing in the hidden

Combat
Ad venturers encounter many dangerous monsters 
and nefarious villains. I n thos e moments, combat 
o ften breaks out.
The Order of Combat
A typical combat encounter i s a clash bet ween two 
 
footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes 
combat into a c ycle of rounds and turns. A round 
repres ents about 6 seconds in the game world. 
During a round, eac h participant in a battle takes a 
turn. The order of turns is determined at the be gin
-
ning of combat when everyone rolls Initi ative . Onc e 

next round if neither side is defeated.
Combat Step by Step
Combat unfolds in thes e step s:

Initiative
Initi ative determines the order of turns during 
combat. When combat starts , every participant 
rolls Initi ative; they m ake a Dexterity check t hat 
determines their plac e in the Initi ative order. The 
GM rolls for monsters. For a g roup of identical crea
-
tures , the GM makes a single roll, so eac h member of 
the group has the same Initi ative .
 
Surprise.
 If a combatant is surpris ed by combat 
starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their 
Initi ative roll. For example, i f an ambusher starts 
combat while hidden from a foe who is un aware 
that combat is starting, that fo e is surpris ed.
 
Init iative Order.
 A combatant™s check total is 
called their Initi ative count, or Initiative for short. 
The GM ranks the c ombatants, from hi ghest to 
lowest Initiative . This is the order in whic h they act 
during eac h round. The Initiative order rem ains the 
same from round to round.
 
Ties.
 If a tie oc curs , the GM decides the order 
among tied monsters , and the pla yers decide the 
order among tied c haracters. The GM decides the 
order if the tie is bet ween a monster and a pla yer 
c haracter.

Melee Attacks
A melee at tack allows you t o at tack a target within 
your reach. A melee at tack t ypically uses a hand
-
held weapon or an Un armed Strike . Many monsters 
make melee at tacks with claws , teeth , or o ther bod y 
parts. A few spells al so involve melee at tacks.

M ounting and Dismounting
During your move, you can mount a creature that 
is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing s o costs

Controlling a M ount
You can control a mount only if it has been trained 
to ac cept a rider. Domesticated hors es , mules , and 
similar creatures have suc h training.

Underwater Combat
 ä
Impeded Wea pons
When making a melee attack roll with a weapon 
underwater, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed has 
Disad vantage on the at tack roll unless the weapon 
deals Piercing damage.
 
A ranged at tack roll with a weapon underwater 
automatically miss es a target beyond the weapon™s 
norm al range, and the attack roll has Disad vantage 
against a target within normal range .
Fire Resista nce
Anything underwater has Resistanc e to F ire dam

age (ex plained in ﬁDam age and Healingﬂ).
Damage and H ealing
Injury and death are frequent threats , as detailed in 
the following rules.
Hit Points
Hit Points repres ent durabil ity and the will to live .

to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of 
Hit Points you ha ve when uninjured. Your current 
Hit Points can be any number from that maximum 
down to 0, whic h is the lowest Hit Points can go.
 
Whenever you take damage, subtract it from your 
Hit Points. Hit Point loss has no eff ect on your capa
-
bilities until you r eac h 0 Hit Points.
 
If you h a ve half your Hit Points or fewer, you™re 
Bloodied, whic h has no game effect on its own but 
whic h might tri gger o ther game eff ects.

When you c reate a damaging e ff ect t hat forc es two

in the blast.
Half Damage
Many sa v ing throw effects deal half damage (round 
down) to a target when the target suc c eeds on the 
sa v ing throw. The halved damage is equal to half 
the dam a ge that would be dealt on a failed sa ve .

successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
Glossary ﬂ a nd have no rule s of their own, but other 
rules , suc h as Resistanc e, rely on damage types.
Resistance and Vulnerabili ty
Some creatures and objects ha ve Resistanc e or 
Vulnerability to certain dam a ge types. If you have 
Resistanc e to a damage type, damage of that t ype 
is halved against you (round down). If you ha ve 
Vulnerability to a d am a ge type, damage of that t ype 
is doubled a gainst you. For example, i f you ha ve 
Resistanc e to Cold damage, suc h damage is halved 
against you, and if you ha ve Vulnerability to F ire 
damage, such damage is doubled a gainst you.
No Sta cking
Multiple instanc es of Resistance or Vul nerability 
that a ffect the same damage type count as only one 
instanc e . For example, i f you have Resistanc e to Ne
-
crotic damage as well a s Resistance to all d amage, 
Necrotic dam a ge is reduc ed by h alf against you.
Order of Application
Ð
order: adjustments suc h as bonus es, p en alties , or 

s econd; and Vulnerability is applied third.
 
For example, a c reature has Resistanc e to all d am
-
age and Vulnerability to F ire damage, and it™s within 
a magical aura that reduc es all d am a ge b y 5. If it 
 
b y 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature™s Resis
-
tanc e (and rounded down to 11), then doubled for 
its Vulnerability (to 22).
Immunity
Some creatures and objects ha ve Immunity to c er
-
tain damage types and conditions. Immunity to a 
damage type means you don™t take damage of that 
type, and Immunity to a condition means you aren™t 
affected by it.
Healing
Hit Points can be restored by ma gic, suc h as the 
Cure Wounds
 spell or a 
Po tion of Healing
, or by a 
S hort or Long Rest (s ee ﬁRules G lossary ﬂ).
 
When you receive healing, add the restored Hit 
Points to your current H it Points. Your Hit Points 
can™t exc eed your Hit Point maximum, so any Hit 
Points re gained in exc ess of the maximum are lost. 
For example, i f you r ec eive 8 Hit Points of healing 
and have 14 Hit Points and a Hit Point maximum of 
20, you re gain 6 Hit Points , not 8 .
Dropping to 0 Hit Poin ts
When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points , it either dies 
outri ght or falls unconscious , as ex plained below.
Instant Death
Here are the main wa ys a creature can d ie instantly.
 
M onster Death.
 A monster dies the instant it 
drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Game Master can 
i gnore this rule for an individu al monster a nd treat 
it like a c haracter.
 
Hit Po int Maximum of 0.
 A c reature dies if its Hit 
Point maximum reac hes 0. Certain e ff ects drain lif e 
energy, reducing a creature™s Hit Point maximum.
 
Massive Damage.
 When dam a ge reduc es a char
-
acter to 0 Hit Points and damage rem ains , the c har
-
acter dies if the remainder equals or exc eeds their 
Hit Point maximum . For example, i f your character 
has a Hit Point m aximum of 12, currently h as 6 Hit 
Points , and takes 18 damage, the c haracter drop s to 
0 Hit Points , but 12 damage rem ains. The c haracter 
then dies, sinc e 12 equ als their Hit Point maximum.
Ch a rac ter Demise
 
wa y to rev ive your character, suc h as with the 
R aise 
Dead
 spell. Or talk with the GM about making a new 
c haracter to join the group. ﬁRules Glossary ﬂ has 
more information on being dead.
Falling Uncon scious
If you reach 0 Hit Points and don™t die instantly, you 
have the Unconscious c ondition (see ﬁRules Glos
-
saryﬂ) until you re gain any Hit Points , and you now 
fac e making Death Sa v ing Throws (s ee below).
D eath S aving Throw s
Whenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Points , 
you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine 
whether you creep clos er to death or hang on to l if e . 
Unlike other saving throws , this one isn™t tied to an 
ability score . You™re in the hands of fate now.
 
Three Successes/Failures.
 Roll 1d20. If the roll 
is 10 or hi gher, you suc ceed. Otherwis e, you fail. A 
succ ess or failure has no eff ect by its elf. On your 
third suc c ess , you become Stable (s ee ﬁ Stabil iz ing a 
C haracterﬂ below). On your third failure, you die .
 
The suc c ess es and failures don™t need to be con
-
s ecutive; keep track of both until you collect t hree 
of a kind. The number of both is res et t o zero when 
you r e gain any Hit Points or become Stable .

18
 
Rolling a 1 or 20.
 When you roll a 1 on the d20 
for a Death Sa v ing Throw, you suff er two failures. If 
you roll a 20 on the d20, you r e gain 1 Hit Point.
 
Damage at 0 Hit Points.
 If you take any dam a ge 
while you ha ve 0 Hit Points , you suff er a Death Sa v
-
ing Throw failure . If the damage is from a C ritical 
Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage 
equ als or exc eeds your Hit Point maximum , you die .
Sta b ilizing a Ch a ra c ter
You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a 
creature with 0 Hit Points , whic h requires a suc
-
c essful DC 10 Wis dom (Medicine) c heck.
 
A Stable creature do esn™t make Death Sa v ing 
Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points , but it s till 
has the Unc onscious condition. If the creature takes 
damage, it stop s being Stable and starts making 
Death Sa v ing Throws a gain . A Stable creature that 
isn™t healed re gains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours.
Temporary Hit Poin ts
Some spells and o ther eff ects conf er Temporary Hit 
Points , which are a buffer against losing actu al Hit 
Points , as ex plained below.
Lose Tempora ry Hit Points First
If you ha ve Temporary Hit Points and take dam age, 
 
carries over to your Hit Points. For example, i f you 
have 5 Temporary Hit Points and take 7 damage, 
you los e thos e points and then los e 2 Hit Points.
D uration
Temporary Hit Points last until they ™re depleted or 
 óä
They Don™t Sta ck
Temporary Hit Points can™t be added together. If 
you ha ve Temporary Hit Points and rec eive more 
of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you 
have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell 
grants you 12 Temporary Hit Points when you a l
-
ready h a ve 10, you can ha ve 12 or 10, not 22.
They™re Not H it Points or Healing
Temporary Hit Points can™t be added to your Hit 
Points , healing can™t restore them, and rec eiv ing 
Temporary Hit Points doesn™t count as healing. Be

If you h a ve 0 Hit Points , rec eiv ing Temporary Hit 
Points do esn™t restore you t o consciousness. Only 
true healing can sa ve you.

2:
 
 
Determine Origin.
 A character™s ori gin includes 
t wo e lements: background and species. How did 
the character s pend the years leading up to a lif e 
of ad venture? Who are the c haracter™s ancestors? 
You can also c hoos e your character™s langu ages.
3:
 
Determine Ability Scores.
 Muc h of what your 
c haracter does in the game depends on the char
-
acter™s six abil ities.

 20
A GM can use feats as a form of ad va ncement after 
characters reach level 20 to provide greater power 
to characters who have no more levels to gain. With 
this a ppro ach, each character gai ns one feat of their 
choice for every 30, 000 XP the character earns 
a b ove 355, 000 XP. Epic Boon feats are especially 
a ppropriate for these b onus feats, but a player ca n 
choose any feat for which their level 20 character 
 
describing the journey from a level 1 character just 
be ginning an ad venturing career to the epic hei ghts 
of level 20. Thes e tiers don™t ha ve any rules associ
-
ated with them; they point to the fact t hat t he pla y 
ex perience evolves as characters g ain levels.
Tier 1 ( Levels 1Œ4)
In tier 1, characters are apprentice ad venturers , 
though they are al read y set apart from the broader 
populac e b y virtue of their extraordin ary abilities. 
They learn their starting class features and choos e 
a subclass. The threats they f ac e usu ally pos e a dan
-
ger to local farmsteads or villages.
Tier 2 ( Levels 5Œ10)
æÐ 
Spellcasters gain iconic spells suc h as 
Fireb all
, 
Light
-
ning Bolt
, and 
R aise Dead
. Most weapon-focused 
class es gain the abil ity to m ake multiple attacks 
in a round. The characters now face dangers that 
threaten cities and kingdoms.
Tier 3 ( Levels 11Œ16)
In tier 3, characters ha ve reac hed a level of power 
that makes them special among a d venturers. At 
level 11, many spell
 

casters learn reality-altering 
spells. Other characters g ain features that allow 
them to make more at tacks or to do more impres
-
sive things with thos e at tacks. Thes e ad venturers 
often confront threats to whole re gions.
Tier 4 ( Levels 17Œ20)
At t ier 4, characters ac hieve the pinn acle of their 
class features , b ecoming heroic arc hetypes. The 
fate of the world or even the order of the multivers e 
might hang in the balanc e during their ad ventures.
Starting at Higher Levels
Your GM might start your group™s characters at a 
level higher than 1. It is particularly recommended 
to start a t level 3 if your group is compos ed of s ea
-
soned D&D pla yers.
Creating Your Character
Creating a h i gher-level character us es the same 
c haracter-creation steps outl ined in this chapter 
and the rules for ad vancing beyond level 1 prov ided 
in the ﬁLevel A d vanc ementﬂ section
.
 You be gin with 
the minimum amount of XP required to reac h your 
starting level. For example, if the GM starts you at 
level 10, you ha ve 64, 000 XP.
Starting Equipm en t
The GM decides whether your character starts with 
more than the standard equipment for a level 1 
c haracter, possibly even one or more magic items. 
The Starting Equipment at Hi gher Levels table is a 
guide for the GM.
 
Also, check with your GM about what equipment 
is available for you to buy w ith your starting money. 
 
are too ex pensive for level 1 characters , but t hey 
might be a vailable for purc hase if your GM allows 
them .
Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you t o gain levels in multiple 
class es. With this rule, you ha ve the option of gain
-
ing a level in a new class whenever you ad vanc e in 
level instead of gaining a level in your current c lass. 
Doing s o lets you mix t he abilitie s of those class es 
to realize a character conc ept that mi ght not be re
-
Ðä
Prerequ isite s
To qualify for a new c lass , you must ha ve a score of 
at least 13 in the primary ability of the new c lass 
and your current c lass es. For example, a Barbari an 
who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must 
have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or h i gher,

Experience Points
The Ex perienc e Point cost to gain a level i s bas ed on 
your total character level, not your level in a p artic
-
ular class , as shown in the C haracter Ad vanc ement 
table in ﬁC haracter Creation .ﬂ For example, if you 
are a level 6 Cleric / level 1 Fighter, you must gain 
enough XP to reac h level 8 before you can take your 
s econd level a s a Fighter or your seventh level a s a 
Cleric.
Hi t Poin ts and Hit Point Dice
You gain the Hit Points from your new c lass as de
-
scribed for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit 
Points for a class only when your total character 
level is 1.
 
Add together the Hit Dic e granted by all your 
class es to form your p ool of Hit Dic e . If thes e dice 
are the same die type, you can pool them together. 
For example, both the F ighter and the Paladin ha ve 
a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fi ghter / level 5 
Paladin, you ha ve ten d10 Hit Dice. If your class es 
give you Hit Dic e of diff erent t ypes , track t hem sep

class™s description in ﬁClasses.ﬂ
Class Feature s
When you gain a new level in a class , you get its f ea
-
tures for that level. A few features ha ve addition al 
rules when you™re multiclassing. Check t he infor
-
mation about multiclassing included in eac h of your 
classes™ descriptions.
 
Special rules apply to Extra At tack, Spellcasting, 
and features (suc h as Un armored D efense) that give 
you a lternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.
Armor Cla ss
If you ha ve multiple wa ys to calculate your Armor 
 Ð 
For example, a Monk/Sorc erer w ith a Monk™s 
Unarmored D ef ens e feature and a S orcerer™s Dra
-
conic Resil ienc e f eature must choos e only one of 
thos e f eatures as a wa y to calculate Armor Class.
Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra At tack feature from more than 
one class , the f eatures don™t stack. You can™t make 
more than two attacks with this feature unless you 
have a feature that says you can (suc h as the F i ght
-
er™s Two Extra At tacks feature).
 
Similarly, the Warlock™s Thirsting Blade invo
-
cation, whic h grants you the Extra At tack feature 
with your pact weapon , do esn™t give you addition al 
at tacks if you a lso have Extra At tack.
Spellca sting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on 
your combined levels in all your spellcasting class es 
and p artly on your i ndiv idu al level s in thos e classes. 
Onc e you ha ve the Spellcasting feature from more 
than one class , us e the rules below. If you multiclass 
but have the Spellcasting feature from only one 
class , follow t he rules for that class.
 
Spell s Prepared.
 You determine what spells you 
can prepare for eac h class indiv idu ally, as if you 
were a single-class ed member of that class. If you 
are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example, 
 
can prepare six Sorc erer spells of level 1 or 2 (as 
well as four Sorcerer cantrip s). 
 
Eac h spell you prepare is associ ated with one of 
your class es, and you us e the spellcasting ability of 
that class when you cast t he spell.
 
Cantrip s.
 If a cantrip of yours increases in power 
at higher levels , the increas e is bas ed on your total 
c haracter level, not your level in a p articular class , 
unless the spell says o therwis e.
 
Spell Slots. 
You determine your available spell 
slots by adding together the following:
Ł
 
All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, D ruid, Sorc erer, 
and Wiz ard class es
Ł
 
Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and 
Ranger classes
Then look up this total level i n the Level column of 
the Multiclass Spellcaster t able . You us e the slots for 
that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from 
any class whos e Spellcasting feature you ha ve .
 
This table mi ght give you spell slots of a hi gher 
level t han the spells you prepare . You can us e thos e 
slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a 
lower-level s pell that you cast, like 
B urning Hands
, 
has an enhanc ed effect when cast a t a hi gher level, 
you can us e the enhanc ed effect as normal.
 
For example, if you are a level
 
4 Ranger / level 3 
Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when de
-
termining your spell slots , counting all your levels 
as a Sorc erer and half your Ranger levels. As shown 

26
in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you ha ve four 
level 1 spell slots , three level 2 slots , and two level 3 
slots. However, you can™t prepare any level 3 spells , 
nor can you prepare any level 2 Ranger s pell s. You 
can us e the spell slots of thos e levels to cast t he 
 
their effects.
 
Pact Magic .
 If you ha ve the Pact Ma gic feature 
from the Warlock c lass and the Spellcasting feature, 
you can us e the spell slots you gain from P act Magic 
to cast spells you ha ve prepared from class es with 
the Spellcasting feature, and you can us e the spell 
slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast 
Warlock spells you ha ve prepared.

Magic Items
 
-
 
items are detailed in ﬁMagic Itemsﬂ later i n this doc
-
ument. Here™s what you need to know a bout using 
magic items.
Identifying a Magic Item
Some magic items are indistinguishable from their 
nonmagical counterparts , while others are c onspic
-
uously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to 
give you a sens e that it is extraordin ary, but learn
-
ing a magic item™s properties isn™t autom atic.
 
The 
Identi fy
 spell i s the fastest wa y to reveal a n 
item™s properties. A ltern atively, you can focus on 
one magic item during a Short Rest while being in 
physical contact with the item . At t he end of the 
rest , you learn its properties and how to us e them 
( but not any c urse the item mi ght bear).
 
Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its prop
-
erties. The command word to activate a ring mi ght 
be etched inside the band, or a feathered desi gn 
might hint that it™s a 
Ring o f Feath er Falling
.
 
Wearing or ex perimenting with an item can also 
 Ð 
of Potions , a lit tle taste is enough to tell t he taster 
what a potion do es. Other items mi ght r equire more 
ex perimentation. For example, i f your character 
puts on a 
Ring o f Swimming
, the GM mi ght sa y, ﬁYour 
ä
dive into a river to s ee what happens. The GM would 
then s a y you swim unex pectedly well.
Attunement
Some magic items require a c reature to form a 
 
creature can us e an item™s magical properties. With
-
out becoming at tuned to an item that requires At
-
Ð 
-
less its description states otherwise . For example, a 
magic Shield that requires At tunement prov ides the 
Ðï 
it, but none of i ts magical properties.
Attune dur ing a Short Rest
At tuning to an item requires you t o spend a Short 
Rest focus ed on only that item while being in physi
-
cal contact with it (this can™t be the same S hort Rest 
us ed to learn the item™s properties). This focus can 
take the form of weapon practic e (for a Weapon), 
meditation (for a Wand), or some other a ppropriate 
activ ity. If the S hort Rest is interrupted, the At
-
tunement at tempt fails. Otherwis e, at t he end of the 
S hort Rest, you™re at tuned to the m a gic item and can 
ac c ess i ts full magical capabilities.
No More Th a n Three Items
You can be at tuned to no more than three magic 
items at a time. Any at tempt to attune to a fourth 
item fails; you must end your At tunement to an item 
Ð ï
one copy of an item. For example, you can™t a t tune to 
more than one 
Ring of Pr ote ction
 at a time .
Ending Attunement
Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer 
satisfy the prerequisites for At tunement , if the item 
has been more than 100 f eet awa y for at least 24 
hours , if you d ie, or if another creature at tunes to 

103
the item. You can also voluntarily end At tunement 
b y spending another Short Rest focus ed on the item 
unless the item is curs ed.
Wearing and Wielding Item s
Using a ma gic item™s properties mi ght mean wear
-
ing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn 
must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on 
f eet, gloves on hands , hats and helmets on a head, 

a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about 
the shoulders. A weapon must be held.
 
In most c as es , a magic item that™s meant to be 
 
Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or 
they magically adjust t hems elves to the wearer.
Multiple Items of the Sa me Kind
You can™t wear more than one of certain magic 
items. You can™t normally wear more than one pair 
of foot wear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets , one pair 
of bracers , one suit of armor, one item of headwear, 
or one clo ak. The GM might make exc eptions.
Paired Items
  
 Ð 
if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a 
c haracter wearing a 
Boot o f Striding and Springing
 
on one foot and a 
Boot of Elvenk ind
 on the other foot 
Ðä
Craf t ing Nonmagic al I tems
To craft a nonm a gical item , you need tool s , raw ma
-
teri al s , and time, eac h of whic h is detailed below. If 
you meet t he requirements , you make the item , and 
you can us e it or sell it at its normal pric e .
Tools
The ﬁ Toolsﬂ section of ﬁEquipmentﬂ lists whic h tools 
are required to make certain items. The GM a ssigns 
required tools for items not listed there .
 
You must us e the required tool to m ake an item 
Ð
 Ðä
Raw Materials
To make an item , you need raw materials worth 
half its purc has e cost (round down). For example, 
you need 750 GP of raw material s to make Plate 
Armor, whic h s ells for 1,500 GP. The GM determines 
whether appropri ate raw materials are a vailable .
Time
To determine how many da ys (working 8 hours a 
da y) it takes to make an item , div ide its purc has e 
cost in GP b y 10 (round a fraction up to a da y). For 
example, you need 5 days to make a Heav y Cross
-
bow, which sells for 50 GP.
 
If an item requires multiple da ys , the da ys needn™t 
be consecutive .
 
C haracters can combine their efforts to shorten 
the crafting time . Div ide the time needed to create 
an item by the number of characters working on it. 
Normally, only one other character can assist you, 
but t he GM mi ght a llow more assistants.
Brewing Pot ions of H ealing
Ð
Kit c an create a 
Po tion of Healing
. Doing s o requires 
using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the 
cours e of 1 da y (8 hours of work).
Sc ribing Spell Sc rolls
A spellcaster can transf er a spell to a s croll and cre
-
ate a 
Spell Scroll
, using the rules below.
Tim e and Cost
Scribing a scroll t akes an amount of time and money 
based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell 
Scroll Costs table . For eac h da y of inscription, you 
must work for 8 hours. If a s croll require s multiple 
days, those days needn™t be consecutive.
Prerequisite s for t he Scribe

ponents required by the spell; if the spell consumes 
its Material components , they are consumed only 
when you complete the scroll. The scroll™s spell u s es

Spell Slots
Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only 
a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. 
Spell slots are the m ain wa y a spellcaster™s magical 
potential is repres ented. Eac h spellcasting class 
gives i ts members a limited number of spell slots of 
c ertain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wiz ard 
has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.
 
When you cast a spell, you e x pend a slot of that

F inishing a Long Rest restores any ex pended spell

On a turn, you can ex pend only one spell slot to cast

-
c entration (s ee ﬁRules Glossary ﬂ) while you do so. If 
your Conc entration is broken, the spell fails, but you 
don™t ex pend a spell slot. To cast t he spell again, you 
must start over.
Rang e
A spell™s range indicates how far from the spell
-
caster the spell™s eff ect c an ori gin ate, and the spell™s

A range usually takes one of the following forms:

If a spell has movable eff ects , they aren™t restricted 
b y its range unless the spell™s de scription sa ys 
otherwis e .
Componen ts
A spell™s components are physical requirements the 
spellcaster must meet to cast the spell. Eac h spell™s 
description indicates whether it requires Verbal 
(V), Som atic (S), or Material (M) c omponents. If the 
spellcaster can™t prov ide one or more of a spell™s 
components , the spellcaster can™t c ast the spell.
Verbal (V)
A Verbal component is the c hanting of esoteric 
words that sound l ike nonsens e to the uninitiated. 
The words must be ut tered in a normal s peaking 
voic e . The words themselves aren™t the sourc e of the 
spell™s p ower; rather, the particular combin ation of 
 Ð 
threads of magic in motion. Thus , a creature who is 
gagged or i n an area of magical silence can™t c ast a 
spell with a Verbal component.
Somatic (S)
A Somatic component is a f orc eful gesticulation 
or a n intricate set of gestures. A spellcaster must 
us e at least one of their hands to perform thes e 
movements.
Material (M)
A Material component is a particular material u s ed

Duration
A spell™s duration is the length of time the spell per
-
sists after it is cast. A duration typically takes one of 
the following forms :
Concentr a tion.
 A duration that requires Conc en
-
tration follows the Conc entration rules (see ﬁRules 
Glossaryﬂ).
Instantaneous.
 An instan taneous duration means 
the spell™s magic appears only for a moment and 
then disappears.
Ti me Span.
 A duration that prov ides a time span 
Ð 
-
utes , hours , or the like . For example, a Duration 
entry mi ght sa y ﬁ1 minute,ﬂ meaning the spell 
ends after 1 minute has passed. While a time-span 
spell that you cast is ongoing, you can d ismiss it 
(no action required) if you don™t ha ve the Incapac

Effects
The eff ects of a spell a re detailed after its dura

spell do es , which i gnores mundane physical laws; 
any outcomes beyond thos e effects are under the 
GM ™s purv iew. Whatever the effects, they typically 
deal with targets , sa v ing throws , at tack rolls , or all 
three, eac h of whic h is detailed below.
Ta rgets
A typical s pell requires the caster to pick one or 
more targets to be aff ected by the spell™s magic. A 
spell™s description sa ys whether the spell targets 
creatures, objects , or something els e .
 
A Clear Path to the Target.
 To target something 
with a spell, a caster must have a c lear p ath to it, so 
it can™t be behind Total Cover.
 
Targeting Yoursel f.
 If a spell t argets a creature 
of your c hoic e, you can choos e yours elf unless the

Ð 
typically one of thes e shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder, 
Eman ation , Line, or Sphere .
 
Awareness of Being Targeted.
 Unless a spell has 
a perc eptible eff ect, a creature doesn™t know it was 
targeted by the spell. An e ff ect like lightning is ob
-
v ious , but a more subtle eff ect, suc h as an at tempt 
to read thoughts , goes unnoticed unless a spell™s 
description sa ys otherwis e .
 
Invalid Targets.
 If you cast a spell on someone 
or something that c an™t be affected by it, nothing 
happens to that target, but if you us ed a spell slot to 
cast t he spell, the slot is still ex pended.
 
If the spell normally has no effect on a target t hat

pears to h a ve suc c eeded on its s a v ing throw, even 
though it didn™t a ttempt one (giv ing no hint t hat the

Wis h
 is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By 
simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality its elf.
 
The basic us e of this spell is to duplicate any other 
spell of level 8 or lower. If you us e it this way, you 
don™t need to meet any requirements to cast that 
spell, including costly c omponents. The spell simply 
takes eff ect.
 
Altern atively, you can create one of the following 
effects of your choice:
Object Crea tion.
 You c reate one object of up to 
25, 000 GP in v alue that isn™t a m agic item. The 
object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimen

Points , and you end all effects on them listed in 
the

 spell.
Resistance.
 You grant up to ten creatures that you 
can s ee Resistanc e to one damage type that you

-
requisite for any of your o ther feats or features.
Roll Redo.
 You undo a single recent event b y forcing 
a reroll of any die roll made within the last round 
(including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to 
ac commodate the new result. For example, a 
Wis h
 
spell could undo an ally ™s failed sa v ing throw or a 
fo e™s Critical Hit. You can forc e the reroll to be made 
with Advantage or Disad vanta ge, and you choos e 
whether to us e the reroll or the ori gin al roll.
Reshape Reality.
 You ma y wish for something not 
included in any of the other eff ects. To do so, state 
your wish to the GM a s precisely as possible . The 
GM has great latitude in ruling what oc curs in 
such an instanc e; the greater the wish, the greater 
the l ikeli hood that something go es wrong. This 
spell might simply f ail, the eff ect you desire mi ght 
be ac hieved only in part, or you mi ght suff er an 
unfores een cons equenc e as a r esult of how you 
worded the wish. For example, wishing that a 
v illain were dead might propel you f orward in 
time to a period when that villain is no longer 
alive, e ffectively remov ing you from the game . 
Similarly, wishing for a Le gendary m agic item or 
an Artif act mi ght instantly transport you to the 
pres enc e of the item™s current owner. If your wish 
is granted and i ts effects ha ve cons equenc es for a 
whole c ommunity, re gion, or world, you are likely 
to at tract powerful foes. If your wish would aff ect

The following sections discuss curs es and ma gical 
contagions in detail.
Curse s
A curs e typically takes one of the forms detailed 
below.
Bestow Curse
The simplest curs es are created by the 
Bestow Curs e
 
spell. The eff ects of suc h curses are limited and can 
be ended by the 
Remove Curse 
spell.
 
Bestow Curse
 prov ides us eful benc hmarks for 
gauging the potency of other curs es. A curs e that 
lasts for 1 minute equates to a level 3 s pell, while 
one that lasts until dispelled equ ates to a level 9 
spell.
Cursed Creatures
Some monsters are associ ated w ith curses , whether 
as part of their ori gins or due to their ability to 
spread curs esŠwerewolves being a prime example .
 
You decide how a spell like 
Remove Curs e
 a ffects 
a c reature with accurs ed origins. For example, you 
might decide that a mummy was created through a 
curs e and it c an be destroyed perm anently only by 
casting 
Remove Curse
 on its corp s e .
Cursed Magic Items
Curs ed magic items are created deliberately or 
origin ate as the result of supern atural events. Such 
items are detailed in ﬁMagic Items.ﬂ
Na rrative Curses
A curs e might manif est during an ad venture when 
a c reature™s v iolation of a taboo warrants supern at

Ð
tomb, or murdering an innoc ent. Suc h a curs e can 
have any eff ects you desi gn, or i t mi ght be a custom
-
ized version of another type of curse discuss ed in 
this section.
 
A creature aff ected by suc h a curs e should know 
why they ™re being punished and be able to learn 
how to end their curs e, likely by s y mbolically 
ri ghting the wrong they c ommitted. How a spell 
like

ad venture is up to youŠthe spell mi ght merely sup

press the eff ects of the curs e for a time . Re gardless , 
n arrative c urs es should feel like rare, potent magic 
rooted in the lore of your campai gn.
Environmental Curses
Some locations are so suffus ed w ith ev il that any
-
one who lingers there is burdened with a curs e . 
Demonic Poss ession is one example of an env iron
-
mental curs e .
 
Dem onic Possession.
 Demonic Possession arises 
from the c haos and ev il of the Ab yss and commonly 
besets creatures that interact with demonic objects 
or linger i n des ecrated locations , where demonic 
spirits await victims.
 
A creature that becomes the target of D emonic 
Poss ession must suc c eed on a DC 15 C harisma sa v
-
ing throw or be poss ess ed by a bodiless demonic 
entity. Whenever the possess ed creature rolls a 1 
on a D20 Test, the demonic entity takes control of 
the creature and determines the creature™s beha v
-
ior thereafter. At the end of eac h of the possess ed 
creature™s later t urns , the creature makes a D C 15 
C harism a sa v ing throw, re gaining control of itself 
on a suc cess.

-
monic Poss ession makes a D C 15 Charisma sa v ing 
throw. On a suc c essful sa ve, the eff ect ends on the 
creature . A 
Disp el Evil and Good 
spell or any m agic 
that removes a curs e also ends the eff ect on it.

Magical Con tagions

Tra veling at altitudes of 10, 000 f eet or higher above

Fear and Mental Stress
Due to the n ature of their vocation, adventurers 
tend to be less susc eptible to f ear and mental stress 
 
terror from a bear or a n apparition, ad venturers are 
made of sterner stuff. That said, certain creatures 
and g ame eff ects can terrify or fra y the mind of 
even the most stalwart ad venturer.
 
If you plan to us e any of thes e rules , discuss them 
with your pla yers at t he start of the campaign.
Fear Eff ects
Whenever the c haracters encounter something that 
is supern aturally frightful, use the F ri ghtened con
-
dition as the bas eline effect. Fear eff ects typically 
require a Wisdom s a v ing throw, with a sa ve DC

Poison
Given their i nsidious and deadly nature, poisons are 
a fa vorite tool a mong assassins and ev il creatures.
 
Poisons come in the following four types:
Contact.
 Contact poison can be smeared on an 
object and remains p otent u ntil it is touched or 
washed off. A c reature that touc hes contact poi
-
son with ex pos ed skin suff ers i ts effects.
Ingested.
 A c reature must s wallow an entire dos e 
of ingested poison to suff er its effects. The dos e 
can be delivered in food or a liquid. You ma y de
-
cide that a parti al dos e has a r educ ed eff ect, suc h 
as allowing Advantage on the sa v ing throw or 
dealing only h alf as much damage on a failed save.
Inhaled.
 Poisonous powders and gas es take effect 
when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing 
the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its 
effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately 
afterward. Holding one™s breath is ineff ective 
against inhaled p oisons , as they aff ect nasal mem
-
branes , tear ducts , and other p arts of the bod y.
Injury.
 Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus 
Action to a weapon, a piec e of ammunition, or 
similar object. The poison remains potent u ntil 
delivered through a wound or washed off. A crea
-
ture that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from 
an object coated with the poison is ex pos ed to its 
effects.
Purchasing Poiso n
In some set tings , laws prohibit the poss ession and 
us e of poison , but an ill icit dealer or unscrupulous 
apothecary mi ght keep a h idden stash. Characters 
with crimin al contacts mi ght be able to acquire poi
-
son easily. Other characters mi ght ha ve to make ex
-
tensive inquiries and p a y bribes before they acquire 
the poison they s eek .
Harve sting Poiso n
A character can attempt to harvest poison from a 
venomous creature that is dead or has the Incapaci
-
tated condition. The effort takes 1d6 minutes , after 
whic h the character makes a D C 20 Intelli genc e 
(Nature) c heck using a Poisoner™s Kit. On a suc cess
-
ful check, the c haracter harvests enough poison 
for a single dos e, and no addition al poison can be 
harvested from that creature . On a failed check, 
the character i s un able to extract any poison. If the 
c haracter fails the c heck by 5 or more, the character 
is subjected to the creature™s p oison.
Sample Poi sons
Example poisons are detailed here in alphabetical 
order. Each poison™s description inclu des the sug
-
gested pric e for a single dos e of the poison, its type 
(c ontact, ingested, inhaled, or i njury), and a descrip
-
tion of the poison™s debil itating effects.
Assa ssin™s Blood (150 GP)
Ingested Pois on
A creature subjected to Assassin™s Blood makes a 
DC 10 Constitution sa v ing throw. On a failed sa ve,

Traps
Traps should be us ed sparingly, lest they los e their 
c harm . A hidden pit c an be a fun surpris e, but too 
many trap s in an ad venture can lead pla yers to be
-
come overly cautious , whic h slows down the game .
 
skilled characters can overcome in a short amount 
of time or deadly puz zles that require quick t hink
-
ing and teamwork to overcome. Trap s that are un
-
detectable and inescapable are rarely f un.
Parts of a Trap
The description of a trap includes the following 
parts after the trap™s name:
Severity and Levels.
 A trap is desi gn ated as a nui
-
sanc e or a s deadly for characters of c ertain levels. 
A nuisanc e trap is unlikely to s eriously h arm char
-
acters of the indicated levels , whereas a deadly 
trap can g rievously dam a ge c haracters of the indi
-
cated levels.
Trigger.
 Traps are often set to go off when a crea
-
ture enters an area or touches an object. Examples 
of tri ggers include stepping on a pressure plate, 
crossing a trip wire, turning a doorknob, or using 
the wrong key in a lock.
Dur a tion. 
Some traps ha ve durations ex press ed 
in rounds , minutes , or hours. Others specify that 
their eff ects last until the trap is destroyed or 
dispelled. If a trap™s duration is instantaneous , its 
effect is resolved instantly. If a trap res ets after 
activating, that fact is noted in this entry. A t rap is 
otherwis e inert after activation.
Use caution when introducing a trap to c haracters 
of a level lower than the trap™s level range . A trap 
that is a nuisanc e at one level range could be deadly 
to c haracters of a lower level range.

Traps are presented in alphabetical order.

Step 3: Spend Your Budget
Every creature has an XP value in its stat block . 
When you add a creature to your combat enc ounter, 
deduct its XP from your X P budget to determine 
how many XP you have left t o spend. Spend as muc h 
of your XP budget as you can without going over. It™s 
OK if you ha ve a few u nspent XP left over. E xamples 
are given below:
Example 1.

of 200 XP. With that, you could build any of the fol

Trouble shooting
When creating and running combat encounters , 
keep the following in mind.
Ma ny Creatures
The more creatures in an encounter, the hi gher 
the risk t hat a lucky streak on their p art could deal 
more dam age to the c haracters than you ex pect. If 
your encounter includes more than two creatures 
per character, include fragile creatures that c an be 
def eated quickly. This guideline is especially im
-
portant for characters of level 1 or 2 .
Adjustments
A pla yer™s abs enc e might warrant remov ing crea
-
tures from an encounter to keep it at t he intended

CR 0 Creatures
Creatures that ha ve a CR of 0, partic ularly ones that 
are worth 0 XP, should be us ed sparingly. If you 
want to include many CR 0 crit ters in an encounter, 
us e swarms instead.
Number of Stat Blocks
The best combat encounters often pair one kind of 
 
with hell hounds. Be mindful of the number of stat 
blocks you need to run the encounter. Ref erencing 
more than two or three stat blocks for a single en
-
counter can be daunting, particularly if the crea
-
tures are complex.
Power f ul Creatures
If your combat encounter i ncludes a creature whos e 
C R is hi gher than the party ™s level, be aware that 
such a creature might deal enough damage with a 
single action to take out one or more c haracters. For 
example, an 
Ogre
 (CR 2) can kill a level 1 Wiz ard 
with a single blow.
Unusual Features
If a monster has a feature that lower-level charac
-
ters can™t easily overcome, consider not adding that 
monster to an encounter for characters whos e level 
is lower than the monster™s Challenge Rating.

make items usa ble only by folk who are sized and

Unusual Anatomy.
 Use your d iscre t ion to decide

Gl ove of Mis sile Snaring
 so long as the 
matchi ng glove is on their person.
Scrolls
An item in the Scroll cate gory is a r oll of paper or 
parc hment, sometimes at tac hed to wooden rods 
and typically kept saf e in a tube of ivory, jade, 
leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is 
the 
Spell Scr oll

leashing the m agic in a scroll requires the us er to

are made of wood, and o thers are compos ed of pol

ished metal or crystal. A staff weighs bet ween 2 and 
7 pounds and serves well a s a walking stick or cane .
 
Unless its description notes otherwis e, a staff can

An item in the Wand cate gory is typically 12 to 15 
inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It 
is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other 
material.

Wondrous Item s
Wondrous Items include wearable items suc h 
as boots , belts , capes , amulets , brooc hes , and 
 
instruments , and more al so fall into this category.
Magic Item Rarity
Every m agic item has a r arity, which prov ides a 
rough measure of an item™s p ower relative to other 
magic items. The rarities are shown in the Ma gic

Magic Item Value s by Rarity
Common magic items can often be bought in a 
town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are 
usually found only in cities , and rarer magic items 
might be sold only in wondrous locations , suc h as a 
city on another plane of existence. If you a llow char
-
acters to buy and sell magic items in your campai gn, 
rarity can help you set prices for thos e items. G old 
Piec e values are prov ided in the Magic Item Rarities

If a magic item incorporates an item that has a

a suit of armor), add that item™s cost to the magic 
item™s value. For example, 
+1 Armor

Act ivating a Magic I tem
It usually takes a Ma gic action to activate a magic 
item. The item™s us er m ight also need to do some
-
thing special. The description of eac h item category 
or i ndiv idual item details how an item is activated. 
C ertain items use the following rules for their 
activation.
Command Word
A command word is a word or short phras e that 
must be spoken or si gned for a n item to work. Spo
-
ken comm and words must be audible and fail to 
work in areas where all sound is suppress ed, as in 
the area of the 
Silen ce
 spell.
Consumable Item s
Some items are consumedŠus ed up, in other 
wordsŠwhen they are activated. A 
Po tion o f Healing
 
must be swallowed, for example, w hile the writing 
vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Onc e us ed, a 
consum able item los es i ts magic.
Spells Cast f rom Items
Some magic items allow t he us er to cast a spell from 
the item. The spell i s cast at t he lowest possible 
spell a nd caster level, do esn™t ex pend any of the us
-
er™s spell slots , and requires no c omponents unless 
the item™s description notes o therwise . The spell 
us es its normal casting time, range, and duration, 
and the us er of the item must conc entrate if the 
spell requires Conc entration. Many items , suc h as 
Potions , bypass the casting of a s pell a nd conf er the 
spell™s effects with its usu al duration. Certain items 
make exc eptions to these rule s, changing the cast
-
ing time, duration, or o ther p arts of a spell.
 
A magic item may require the user to us e their 
own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from 
the item. If the us er has more than one spellcasting 
ability, the us er choos es whic h one to us e with the 
item. If the us er do esn™t ha ve a spellcasting abil ity,

Tim e and Cost
Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and 
money based on the item™s rarity as shown in the 
Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table .
 
Work per Day.
 For eac h day of crafting, you must 
work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple da ys , 
thos e da ys needn™t be cons ecutive .
 
Assistants.
 Characters can combine their efforts 
to shorten the crafting time . Div ide the time needed 
to create an item by the number of characters work

assist you, but t he GM might a llow more assistants.
 
R aw M aterials.
 The cost in the table repres ents 
the raw materials needed to m ake a magic item. The 
GM determines whether appropriate raw m ateri al s 
are a vailable . I n a city, there is a 75 perc ent chanc e 
that the materi als are a vailable, and in any other 
s et tlement , that chanc e is 25 perc ent. If materi als 
aren™t available, you must wait at least 7 da ys before

If a magic item incorporates an item that has a

you must al so pay that entire cost or craft t hat item 
using the rules in ﬁEquipment.ﬂ For example, to

Sentient Magic Items
Some magic items ha ve s entienc e and person ality. 
Such an item might be poss ess ed, haunted by the 
spirit of a prev ious owner, or self-aware thanks to 
the m agic us ed to create it. A sentient item might be 
a c herished ally to its wielder or a continu al thorn in

Most sentient items are weapons , but other kinds 
of i tems can manifest sentienc e . Single-use items 
such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.

A stat block u su ally prov ides both a number and a 
die ex pression for eac h instanc e of damage . For ex
-
ample, an at tack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a 
hit. You decide whether to us e the number or the die 
ex pression in parenthes es; don™t us e both.
Multiatta ck
Some creatures can make more than one at tack 
when they take the At tack action. Suc h creatures

an at tack roll). Unless noted o therwis e, a s pell of 
level 1 or hi gher is alwa ys cast a t its lowest possible 
level a nd can™t be cast a t a higher level.
 
A monster™s spell can ha ve speci al rules or restric

Invisi
-
bility
 spell, but the spell has a ﬁs elf only ﬂ restriction, 
whic h means the spell aff ects only the hag.

 The Spellcasting trait notes 
whether the monster™s spellcasting ignores the 
need for certain spell components. If any spell com
-
ponents are required, describe the monster™s us e of
